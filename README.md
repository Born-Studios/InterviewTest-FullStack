## Full Stack Developer Test

### Overview
This is the test we ask for all Full Stack Developer candidates to complete 
in our hiring process. The purpose of this test is to give us a sample of 
your thinking process as a software developer, a sample of the coding practices your currently 
follow, and some idea on how you apply programming concepts to solve problems.
We will have a follow-up discussion after you submit the test to us so 
the test itself provides the basis for us to have that discussion.

### Duration
You're free to complete the test at your own pace. It shouldn't take 
more than 2 hours of your time. If you see that it's taking longer, 
feel free to stop spending time on the implementation at that point 
and just make notes for us to go through in the follow-up interview.

### Required Tools
* node.js
* Visual Studio Code

### Project
The project is a website that displays the current temperature for cities in the UK.
It gets the temperature data from https://open-meteo.com/. A list of available cities
can be found in the data folder (gb.csv).

There are three folders:
* backend: An express.js (https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html) backend.
* frontend: Contains a skeleton index.html
* data: Contains the gb.csv data file

### Objectives
* Add a text field to the web page in which the user enters the name of a city in the UK
* Add a search button that retrieves the current temperature of a city in the gb.csv file
* Display the temperature for the city or an error if the city is not found in the data file

This task can be solved with or without custom endpoints. Your choice will be part of the 
follow-up discussion.

The backend runs on http://localhost:3000 and doesn't have to be hosted anywhere.
